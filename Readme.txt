#ISMP Package (Identifying Solar Magnetic Patches)

The ISMP code package employs a complex network method to detect both large and small magnetic 
patches on the Sun's surface. The main routine and its corresponding functions are developed in MATLAB.
However, some parts of the algorithm are also available for Python users. In the future, the complete Python 
the package will be available as well.
